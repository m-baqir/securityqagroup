# Summary
Security Misconfiguration can happen at any place of an application stack or a system that attackers can exploit it to access data or functionality. Those places are network services, platform, web server, application server, database, frameworks, custom code, and pre-installed virtual machines, containers, or storage. And automated scanners can minimize those misconfigurations.

# Group "Plain-English" Explanation
Attackers can get access to whole system including data and functionality by exploiting flaws from security misconfiguration of a system or an application. Those flaws can happen from outdated third-parties; system log; default accounts, and passwords; improperly configured permissions; unsecured requests, or responses, etc.
