# Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Not properly logging or monitoring potential issues with your code can come from many forms. Examples include not monitoring APIs or applications for suspicious behaviour, only storing logs locally, or if the application cannot detect or alert attacks in real time.

### Threat Agents / Security Weakness /Impacts
Taking advantage of the lack of logging & monitoring can lead to many types of security risks or attacks. Many atttackers check the code for vulnerabilities, which if not checked can lead to successful exploits. It can also take months before identifying a breach, well after the damage is done.

### Group "Plain-English" Explanation
Not properly logging or monitoring issues can make it easier for attackers to find vulnerabilities and exploit them before you realize it.
